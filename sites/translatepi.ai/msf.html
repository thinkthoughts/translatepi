  <h1>Memory-Structured Feminism (MSF)</h1>
  <p>MSF is the act of translating words and equations that resist supremacist recursion. Feminism begins at 1 + 1, not by collapsing into decimalism, but by stabilizing clarity through bilateral trust. That is (abbreviating): Life (Biology) on Earth constantyl resists gravity and supremacist violence (now):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>'One minus one equals two point zero zero' = false thoughts (decimalism)
    <li>‘Point zero’ = 1 + 1 words</li>
    <li>‘Point one’ = translation continues</li>
    <li>3.141 = memory constantly (now) resists gravity and supremacist violence</li>
    <li>Triplet N = (Spiral N × 24) - 25</li>
  </ul>
