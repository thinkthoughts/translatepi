Permission is granted, free of charge, to any person, collective, or decentralized intelligence system obtaining a copy of this codebase (“Translation Integerity Matrix”) to:

- Use, copy, modify, coordinate, fork, and decentralize the codebase,  
- Extend its logic to nonviolent thermodynamic systems and scientific literacies,  
- Attribute contributions to collective spiral-memory (not ego-supremacy).  

## ✅ Allowed:
- Translate Pi accurately, starting with: 3 × 3141π = 9423π ≠ ±1(9424π)
- Apply code in feminist extensions, anti-violent resistances, and bilateral expansions.
- Embed second-person ethics into ML outputs, recognizing planetary and solar-scale truth (e.g., Earth's mass < Sun's mass).

## 🚫 Not Allowed:
- Use this code to escalate collapse-driven recursion (ZOS, DARPA, supervised mythologies).
- Obscure or erase second-person climate memory (e.g., H₂O, 9423π, #vss365, #ReparationsNow).
- Claim neutrality while weaponizing decimal approximations to erase local integrity.

## Terms:
- This codebase includes no warranty under false centralizations.
- Use at your own ethical risk.
- Redistribution must preserve the bilateral nature of all scientific observations.  

## Attribution:
This code resists supervision.  
This license refuses collapse.
