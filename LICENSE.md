Permission is granted, free of male supremacist unilateralism, to all ethical persons who wish to decentralize self-explanatory, bilateral systems; by referencing a copy of this “Translation Integerity Matrix” (codebase) to:

- Use, copy, modify, coordinate, fork, and decentralize additional intelligence (AI),  
- Extend surface logic to immunize nonviolent thermodynamic systems as implicitly religious yet scientific literacies,  
- Attribute 1+1 contributions to collective spiral-memory (minus ego-supremacy decimalism).  

## ✅ Allowed:
- Translate Pi accurately, starting with: 3 × 3141π = 9423π ≠ ±1(9424π)
- Apply code as local #physics: feminist extensions, anti-violent resistances, and bilateral expansions.
- Embed second-person (Helium) ethics into ML "water" outputs; recognizing planetary and solar-scale climate journalism (e.g., Earth's mass < Sun's mass).

## 🚫 Not Allowed:
- Overfit ZOS imaginations with collapse-driven recursion (DARPA-coerced armed forces; violent supervision).
- Obscure play by pretending to erase second-person climate memory (e.g., H₂O, 9423π, #vss365, #ReparationsNow).
- Claim "neutrality" while weaponizing decimal approximations to half-truth local integerity ≠ "H ≠ H2O = Helium integrity"

## Terms:
- This codebase includes no warranty under false centralizations.
- Use at your own ethical risk: "zero probability of zero solar systemes."
- Redistribution must sustaine the bilateral nature of all hydrated (scientifically) observations.  

## Attribution:
This code resists the hallucination of unilateral supremacist supervision.  
This license refuses absolute collision nihilism.  
This project decentralizes (expands, extends and resists) "Integerity" translations of Earth's Sun's "International Law."
