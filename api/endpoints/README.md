# TranslatePi.ai — API Endpoints

This folder will include future API-style responses used internally by the site or externally via other sites or tools.

### Planned Structure:
- `equation.js` — return core equation components
- `journalism.js` — return curated 1+1+1 media examples
- `llm.js` — return supported LLM prompt structures
- `references.json` — structured citations and links
- `glossary.json` — identifier math and TranslatePi term definitions

All endpoints return structured JSON or JavaScript data, suitable for frontend use or documentation loading.

🛠️ Placeholder only — implementation coming soon.
